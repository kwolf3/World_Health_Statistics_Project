# World_Health_Statistics_Project

This project utilizes statistical learning to answer a number of research questions regarding world health. To see the final project deliverables including original datasets, final datasets, code for the models, and the final report, please select the folder labeled IS517-Wolf_Choudhry-Final_Project_Deliverables.

For this project, we focused on three research questions applied in the context of countries of the world:

1. How well do healthcare factors do in comparison with economic factors in predicting life expectancies (both healthy life expectancy and life expectancy at birth)?
2. Are we able to successfully predict life expectancy at birth and healthy life expectancy at birth by a) health infrastructure and b) health behaviors?
3. Is there a significant difference between factors that predict healthy life expectancy versus life expectancy, and if so, what factors cause this?
4. Which statistical methods deliver the best performance on this dataset?
